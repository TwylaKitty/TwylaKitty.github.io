                <p><i>Welcome!</i></p>
                <p>I'm Twyla and this is <i>my</i> very own webpage!</p>
                <p>I can post things I've made or tell you all about the things I love or am learning in school or at home. I plan to add lots of new things to my webpage in the future.</p>
                <img src="imgs/books1.png" alt="books" style="float: right;" /><hr />
                <p>My Mommy thought it would be fun to make me my very own webpage. I got to help and learn some new things too! I might make a page all by myself soon! <i>Maybe Nyan Cat themed!</i> For now I've got a place to put pictures I've drawn, stories I've written, and tell you all about me and things I love. Mommy says I should write book reviews too. I go to the library all the time to get new books. I love reading! We put a link to the library in the links list. Also, in the links section, there are webpage design things, videos I love, and games.</p>
                <hr />
                <img src="imgs/uni2.png" alt="unicorn" style="float: left;" /><p>Right now I'm working with my Mommy to make a page that's just about me. I'll have list of stuff I love, like my favorite foods, my best friends, my favorite things to do, etc. We might have a page what's going on in school too. Maybe if I do really well on a spelling test or win a spelling bee, or something like that I'd post that kind of thing there.</p>
                <p>Thanks for coming to see my webpage! I hope you like it!</p>
